There are 3 enemy types:
Red are the smallest ones and gives 10 points each
Blue are the mid range enemy and gives 5 points each
Green are the largest ones and gives only 1 points each

The player starts with an amount of 5 health points and loses 1 point for each of the squares that reaches the bottom of the screen.
The player earn points by clicking the squares
The game checks if the player is holding the left mouse button, so you can't cheat!

This is my first game, hope you enjoy!
